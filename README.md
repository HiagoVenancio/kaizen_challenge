1. Improve Image Loading with Performance Optimization
Why: Demonstrates your ability to handle network-heavy operations efficiently.
What to Implement:
Implement image caching using libraries like Coil or Glide.
Use placeholder animations while images are being loaded.
Show blurred placeholders and reveal the image progressively.
Implement a lazy-loading mechanism with pagination for your list.


2. Introduce Animations
Why: Animations make your app engaging and visually appealing, showcasing your expertise in Compose and UI.
What to Implement:
Use AnimatedVisibility for smooth transitions.
Add swipe-to-dismiss gestures for items in the list.
Animate the favorite button with animateFloatAsState for a bounce effect when clicked.
Implement a card flip animation for toggling between the property‚Äôs front and details.


3. Add Background Services with WorkManager
Why: Shows your ability to handle periodic background tasks efficiently.
What to Implement:
Sync data periodically with an API.
Pre-fetch images or data to enhance the offline experience.
Push notifications to highlight favorite or new properties.


4. Enhance Navigation
Why: Demonstrates your understanding of Jetpack Navigation and dynamic route handling.
What to Implement:
Support bottom navigation or a drawer menu for better UX.
Implement nested graphs to handle sections like favorites or profile.
Support deep links in the future.


5. Offline Mode
Why: Shows advanced skills in caching and improving the app experience.
What to Implement:
Store API data locally using Room or DataStore.
Use cached data when the network is unavailable.
Sync data automatically when back online.


6. Advanced Filters and Sorting
Why: Demonstrates your ability to implement complex UI logic.
What to Implement:
Add filters (e.g., price range, bedrooms, bathrooms).
Support sorting by price, size, or proximity.
Use Jetpack Compose Modifiers for interactive sliders or chips.
How to Implement:
Use LazyColumn and add a filter bar at the top.
Use remember and mutableStateOf to store and apply filters dynamically.


7. Improve Accessibility and Localization
Why: Highlights your ability to create inclusive apps.
What to Implement:
Add support for multiple languages.
Ensure screen readers work seamlessly with contentDescription.
Use high-contrast themes for accessibility.
How to Implement:
Store strings in strings.xml for localization.
Use contentDescription for all images and icons.
